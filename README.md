# Math Animations

This is a collection of mathematical animations built using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a Python software created and used by 3Blue1Brown. It focuses on visualizing abstract and complex mathematical concepts like:

- Gaussian integers and lattice geometry
- Euclidean domains and number theory
- Field extensions and algebraic structures

### Gaussian Integers as a Euclidean Domain

</div>

The above is a shortened animation of the Gaussian integer lattice, showing that for every complex number *z*, there exists a Gaussian integer Œ± in **‚Ñ§[i]** that is "close enough" to *z*. The visual demonstrates how the lattice structure of **‚Ñ§[i]** guarantees norm reduction, supporting its Euclidean domain property.
